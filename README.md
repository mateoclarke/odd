City of Austin Office of Design & Delivery
==========================

This repo is for our public-facing site, which is hosted on austintexas.io.  This site is the main funnel for recruiting and outreach.

The site is forked from a fork of [usds.gov](https://usds.gov), which is built on the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) and uses Jekyll to generate static pages.

## Setup
---
1. If you're using a Mac, install homebrew (see http://brew.sh/)
2. After installing git (`brew install git`), `cd` to the directory where you want to check-out the site, and then clone it (`git clone https://github.com/cityofaustin/innovation-fellows.git`)
3. Install rvm (`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable`), make your current user a member of the rvm group, and then install a new version of ruby (`rvm install 2.3.1`) or make sure you're using it: `rvm use 2.3.1`
4. Install the `bundler` gem, then use bundler to install other project dependencies (`gem install bundler && bundle install`)

## Running
---
1. In the directory you checked out the website into, run `jekyll serve` to start the webserver
2. Navigate to http://localhost:4000 in your browser to see your changes

## Usage

### Navigation

Pages in subfolders, like `parent/child.md`, render as visual children of their parent, e.g. `parent.md`. The parent page must exist for the child page to appear in the navigation, however if it has the `layout: redirect`, the parent will only display as a header above it's children.
